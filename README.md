### Abstract. 
Counter-Strike is a statistically-heavy esport with little publicized analytical research. This project takes data from multiple tournaments and uses it to examine the impact of the first kill and the in-game economy on win rate. A separate dataset is used to build a prediction model that forecasts the future careers of various players aged 19 and under. Our analysis concluded that the first kill in a round was of significant importance. It also showed how poor economy management could lead to serious consequences. The prediction model returned that Mathieu "ZywOo" Herbaut has the most potential of all players under 20.
